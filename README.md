# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Incorrect $sum in $group stage
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The original code incorrectly uses a string instead of a field within the `$sum` operator in the `$group` stage. This leads to inaccurate aggregation results.  The corrected code is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description
The original code attempts to sum the values of the 'value' field, but it incorrectly specifies the field name as a string. This leads to the `$sum` operator treating the string as a literal value rather than a field path. As such, every item will add the string "$value" to the total instead of the actual numeric value, which is wrong and produces unintended results.

## Solution
The corrected code changes the `$sum` operator to correctly reference the field using the `$value` expression, ensuring that numerical values are properly summed within the `$group` stage. The corrected code is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
